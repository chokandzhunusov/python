**** 4.7. Taking a Slice of an Iterator
***************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
# You want to take a slice of data produced by an iterator,
# but the normal slicing operator doesnâ€™t work.

#########
# Solution
#########
# The itertools.islice() function is perfectly suited
# for taking slices of iterators and generators.

import itertools


# TODO
# Write a generator function that will take `n` as arg and increment it.

def count(n):
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Code goes here
    # print slice 10:20 using `loop` and `islice` method
    pass
