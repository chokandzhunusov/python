**** 4.10. Iterating Over the Index-Value Pairs of a Sequence
*************************************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
# You want to iterate over a sequence, but would like to keep track
# of which element of the sequence is currently being processed.

#########
# Solution
#########
# The built-in enumerate() function handles this quite nicely.
