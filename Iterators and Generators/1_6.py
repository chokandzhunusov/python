**** 4.6. Defining Generator Functions with Extra State
*******************************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
# You would like to define a generator function,
# but it involves extra state that you would like to expose to the user somehow.

#########
# Solution
#########
# If you want a generator to expose extra state to the user,
# donâ€™t forget that you can easily implement it as a class,
# putting the generator function code in the __iter__() method.
