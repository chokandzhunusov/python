********************************************
**** 4.4. Implementing the Iterator Protocol
********************************************


#########
# Problem
#########
# You are building custom objects on which you would like to support iteration,
# but would like an easy way to implement the iterator protocol.



#########
# Solution
#########
# Easiest way to implement iteration on an object is to use a generator function.
# Perhaps you want to implement an iterator that traverses nodes in a depth-first pattern.
