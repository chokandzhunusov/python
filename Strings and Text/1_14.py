**** 1.14. Combining and Concatenating Strings
************************************************************


#########
# Problem
#########
# You want to combine many small strings together into a larger string.


#########
# Solution
#########
# If the strings you wish to combine are found in a sequence or iterable,
# the fastest way to combine them is to use the `join()` method.

# Print the variables above by separating them with ':',
# the idea is to show lookouts for unnecessary string concatenations.
