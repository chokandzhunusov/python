**** 1.12. Determining the Most Frequently Occurring Items in a Sequence
************************************************************


#########
# Problem
#########
# You have a sequence of items,
# and youâ€™d like to determine the most frequently occurring items in the sequence.


#########
# Solution
#########
# The `collections.Counter` class is designed for just such a problem.
# It even comes with a handy `most_common()` method that will give you the answer.
# As input, Counter objects can be fed any sequence of hashable input items.

# Filter the `words` var above, so that it counts repeated words

# Add `more_words` to words using method not loop

# TODO
# Combine `words` and  `more_words`
