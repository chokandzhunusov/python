**** 5.5. Writing to a File That Doesn’t Already Exist
******************************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
#   You want to write data to a file,
    but only if it doesn’t already exist on the filesystem.

# Solution

#   This problem is easily solved by using the little-known
    `x` mode to open() instead of the usual w mode.
