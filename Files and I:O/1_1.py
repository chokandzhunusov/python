**** 5.1. Reading and Writing Text Data
***************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
    - You need to read or write text data,
      possibly in different text encodings such as ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16.

#########
# Solution
#########
    - Use the `open()` function with mode `rt` to read a text file.
    - Use `open()` with mode `wt` to write a text file.

# TODO
#   - Read the entire file as a single string.
    - Iterate over the lines of the file.
    - Write chunks of text data.
