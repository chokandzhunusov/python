**** 5.3. Printing with a Different Separator or Line Ending
*************************************************************

#########
# Problem
#########
    - You want to output data using print(),
      but you also want to change the separator character or line ending.

#########
# Solution
#########
    - Use the `sep` and `end` keyword arguments to print(),
      to change the output as you wish.

# TODO:
    - Print it by separating comma: 'ACME', 50, 91.5
    - "                           " and by adding `!!\n` at the end.
    - Print nums in range(5) one by one and in one line.
    - Try to print `join` of `row` below and face an error.
    - Try to print `row` below by using `join` and separator comma(,)
    - Now print `row` using `sep` key of `print`.
